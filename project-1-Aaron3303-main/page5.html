    <h3 id="h35">How benefitial is building a computer?</h3>
    <p id="p5">Certainly! Building a computer can be beneficial for cost savings, customization, upgradability, 
        gaining knowledge and skills, optimizing performance, and ensuring quality control. However, 
        it requires time, effort, and technical knowledge. Drawbacks include the lack of pre-installed 
        operating system and software, potential challenges in warranty and support, and the learning curve 
        for those unfamiliar with the process. The decision to build a computer depends on individual needs, 
        budget, and comfort with technical aspects.</p>

    <h3 id="h35">What can building a computer teach you?</h3>
    <p id="p5">Building a computer can be a valuable and educational experience that teaches you various skills and 
        concepts. Here are some of the key benefits: Hardware Understanding, Component Identification: You'll 
        learn to identify and understand the purpose of various hardware components like the CPU, GPU, RAM, motherboard, 
        storage devices, power supply, and more. Software Installation, Operating System: Installing an operating 
        system and device drivers is typically part of building a computer. This helps you understand software 
        installation processes. Basic Programming and BIOS/UEFI Understanding, BIOS/UEFI Settings: You may need to configure 
        BIOS/UEFI settings during the build, teaching you the basics of firmware settings. Software Setup: Building a 
        computer often involves installing and configuring software, helping you get familiar with basic software setup.
        Building a computer is a practical, hands-on experience that combines both hardware and software aspects, offering 
        a holistic understanding of computer systems.</p>

    <h3 id="h35">How easy is it to build a computer?</h3>
    <p id="p5">Building a computer is generally considered relatively easy, especially for basic desktop configurations. 
        Abundant online resources, step-by-step guides, and video tutorials provide detailed instructions. 
        Attention to detail, compatibility checks, and following instructions are crucial. Components are 
        often modular and use standardized connectors, making assembly straightforward. Basic tools like 
        screwdrivers are usually sufficient. While potential challenges exist, troubleshooting skills and 
        online communities can provide support. Beginners can start with simpler builds and gradually advance 
        as they gain experience and confidence.</p>

    <h3 id="h35">Should universities teach computer hardware students how to build a computer?</h3>
    <p id="p5">Teaching computer hardware students how to build a computer is beneficial for several reasons. It 
        provides hands-on experience, applies theoretical concepts practically, enhances problem-solving skills, 
        and prepares students for real-world scenarios in their future careers. Building computers promotes 
        teamwork, collaboration, and a deeper appreciation for technology. Graduates with this skill may be 
        more confident and competitive in the job market, and the experience fosters a sense of community 
        among students. Integrating computer assembly into the curriculum contributes to a well-rounded education 
        aligned with the needs of the evolving tech industry.</p>
