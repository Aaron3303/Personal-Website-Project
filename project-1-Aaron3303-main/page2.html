            <h3 id="h32">Arduino Powered LED Cube</h3>
            <p id="p2">This project uses an arduino nano board to power an array of LEDS to display
            numerous predefined animations. This project used a blank PCB board, copper wire
            soldering tools, LEDS, and an arduino nano board. Using the soldering tools
            the copper wire was soldered together with the LEDS in 4 layers then soldered to the 
            PCB board. The wire poking through the PCB board was then soldered to the pins of arduino 
            motherboard. The next step was to upload the code the arduino and plug into a source of power.
            The LEDS would now be able to light up in different animations.

            <h3 id="h32">Personal Computers</h3>
            <p id="p2">This project uses standard computer parts such as a motherboard, power suppply, 
            processor, and graphics card to construct a personal desktop computer. The first step
            was to insert the processor into the motherboard then attach the cooler onto it after.
            Next would be to insert it into the computer case and insert the graphics card into the motherboard.
            The last step is to connect all the cables from the power supply into the respective slots on the 
            motherboard and graphics card. After setting up the BIOS and installing an operating system the 
            computer is completed. Over the years I have built more than few a computers for myself, friends,
            and family.
